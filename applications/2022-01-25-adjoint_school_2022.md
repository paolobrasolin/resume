# Adjoint School 2022 Application Form

Online application form. Please complete all the questions!

DEADLINE: Saturday, January 29, 2022, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth).

We welcome anyone, from anywhere in the world, who is interested in applying category-theoretic methods to problems outside of pure mathematics. This is emphatically not restricted to math students, but one should be comfortable working with mathematics. In selecting participants we aim to design groups with a mix of people specializing in category theory and in applied fields.

We will consider advanced undergraduates, PhD students, post-docs, as well as people working outside of academia. Members of groups which are underrepresented in the mathematics and computer science communities are especially encouraged to apply.

Please use the same email as in your pre-application form. We will use this email to identify you.

(~250 words) Instead of a CV, write a short paragraph about your educational and/or professional background. Please mention your current occupation or position. This is your opportunity to brag about yourself!

> My education started with a BSc in Physics.
> Then I fruitfully pursued an MSc in Theoretical Physics, before quitting out of frustration with the rather dry environment.
>
> Searching for stimuli, I tapped into my lifelong affinity with computers and jumpstarted a freelancing career oriented towards publishing and OSS.
> I spent three years cultivating business relationships, honing tact and foresight.
> Two achievements stand taller: renovating Manning's high-profile LaTeX publishing pipeline, and contributing tools and ideas to an authoring meta-standard submitted as "AsciiRFC" to the IETF.
>
> Then I realized some things are unachievable alone, and I wasn't learning to build teams and foster collaboration.
> Therefore, I got myself hired in a tiny software company demanding to practice exactly that.
> Beginning as a fiercely curious generalist pushing on the forefront, I gradually turned inwards to nurture and coordinate my peers, ultimately being acknowledged as a team leader.
> During four years we quadrupled our size, knitted a tight crew of specialists, and obtained a contract with a multibillion-dollar company.
>
> Last November I left, seeking for purpose.
> I committed to resuming studies, setting my lodestar to the spark I saw when first introduced to CT a decade ago: many forays since then let me witness how exciting the ACT space has become.
>
> I'm currently a Researcher in Computational Linguistics at Eurac Research, where I found a flourishing environment of open-minded people sharing my views on OSS and Open Science.
> There, while putting my technical expertise to good use, I aspire to stir the boundary between the three most powerful realms I know: math, code, and language.

## Interest and expectations for ACT School

**Describe your interest in the ACT School.**
(~250 words) For example: What would you like to get out of this school? How can this school help you in your career or research goals? What aspects of the school appeal most to you?

> Above everything else, I'd like to get a chance to hit the ground running with the actual practice of CT.
> While I'm currently interested in the theory of natural and programming languages, whatever research direction I might take in the future I want CT to be part of it because I'm enthralled by its possibilities and I desire to gain good control over it.
>
> I'm aware that due to my somewhat unorthodox background this school might be a trial by fire, as I'll probably have a lot more learning to do than an early-career mathematician.
> I have accounted for this: I'm willing and able to use up to half of my time to compensate since my current research position affords me such flexibility.
> Furthermore, despite the potential hardship, I see this with enthusiasm as an outstanding and unique opportunity to get a huge practical knowledge boost which I can put to immediate use during a hard turn in my career.
>
> Having the school structured around the commitment to study and immediately apply ourselves to presenting and writing material feels like an excellent strategy to keep it concrete and make it as profitable as possible.
> That's an extremely appealing aspect, second only to the prospect of intense work with equally enthusiastic students and renowned tutors.

**Expectations for participants**
Please read the expectations for participants here http://adjointschool.com/about.html

> ✓ I can commit to attending biweekly talks and meeting with my group during the learning seminar
> ✓ I can commit to giving a presentation and writing a blog post

**The in-person research week will be held July 11 - 15 at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. We have applied for funding to subsidize the cost of attending, however the availability of funding is uncertain at this time.**

**To what extent can you commit to coming to Strathclyde for the in-person research week?**

> I'm very interested in physical participation!
> I believe there's a chance my own institution (Eurac) would be willing to cover at least some of my expenses.
> Should no funding (yours or theirs) be available, I might be able to afford the expenses myself (even though to say that with certainty I need to know their amount which I'm only vaguely guessing at the moment).

## Category theory and project interests

**Describe your background in category theory.**
Please write one or two sentences about your background in category theory. For example: Are you new to category theory? Have you done readings or taken classes in category theory?

> My first contact 10 years ago was with Mac Lane's book; I read a chunk of it mostly alone, absorbing what I could. Then, in time, I had a few other forays: topoi when reflecting about my possible MSc thesis, monads with relation to programming, and some small pet projects.
>
> Now that I'm adamant about CT, I don't feel like these cursory looks afforded me to grok things nearly as well as I expect myself to. Therefore, along with the casual readings, I'm having a clean start by following the 2022 ItaCa course, and hopefully the 2022 TalTech course (strongly oriented towards applications) will be useful too.

**Describe what excites you about applied category theory.**
(~250 words) For example: You can talk about your favorite topic in category theory, a connection between category theory and your domain field, or your interest in one of the projects.

> CT as a whole is an amazing construct: a display of essential and principled design which, by virtue of its unhindered minimalism, is able to reach far and wide.
> The evidence of that is found looking at it in action as ACT, which is akin to witnessing a nimble blade sharp enough to cut, plane, and carve through materials completely unforeseen by its creator.
>
> That is what excites me, even if it's a tad romantic.
>
> Keeping my feet on the ground, a topic that has currently piqued my interest is fibrational linguistics.
> I was lucky enough to be personally present during its inception, and I think it's a prime example of the unreasonable effectiveness of categorial language.
> With a few relatively simple tools, it's possible to build a model of "speakers and their interactions" (explaining, teaching, translating) with almost no assumptions on the underlying models of language and meaning.
> I see great potential in this and I'm determined to make this accessible and known among "traditional" linguists.
>
> As for my preferred project, I reckon it's pretty hard to choose.
> "Compositional Thermodynamics" immediately resonates with my first love for physics (and how a younger me looked up to Baez) while the other three are all somehow related to my current general interest in logic and computation.
> To pick two favorites: Bonchi's project (which is missing a description, but I found a recap by Pawel Sobocinski) is an exciting challenge to approach the limits of what's known about diagrammatic calculi and their relations to computation, while "Opinion Dynamics" is immensely interesting to me because of the implications of describing everyday reality using type theory.
